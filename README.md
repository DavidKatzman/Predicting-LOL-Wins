# Predicting Wins in League of Legends at the 10 minute mark

## Goal

- This project aims to determine whether the blue team or the red team will win a game of league of legends at the 10 minute mark based on certain statistics about the game, including gold, kills, and experience (an in-game statistic, not how much experience the players have playing the game)
- The games are all from the diamond elo, which means that the players are some of the best players at the game
